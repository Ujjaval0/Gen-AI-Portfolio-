# 🔧 Quick Fix: Vercel 404 Function Error

## ❌ Error
```
Function invocation - 404 not found
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Problem:** Vercel couldn't find the Python function because `api/index.py` was trying to import from `backend/main.py`, which doesn't work in Vercel's serverless environment.

**Fix:** Made `api/index.py` a **self-contained** FastAPI application with all chatbot logic included directly.

## 📝 What Changed

**Before (❌ Didn't Work):**
```python
# api/index.py
from main import app  # Tried to import from backend/
```

**After (✅ Works):**
```python
# api/index.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
# All chatbot logic included directly
```

## 🚀 Deployed

Changes pushed to GitHub. Vercel is deploying now (~2 minutes).

## ✅ Verify After Deployment

1. **Health Check:** `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/health`
   - Should return: `{"status": "healthy"}`

2. **Test Chatbot:**
   - Click "Resume" button
   - Type "Hi"
   - Should get AI response

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Functions → `/api/index`
   - Should see successful requests, no 404 errors

## 🎯 Why This Works

- Vercel serverless functions need to be **self-contained**
- Can't reliably import from parent directories
- All code must be in the `api/` folder or dependencies

**Your deployment should work now!** ✅
